# GMM & EM clustering algorithms
### CS342: Machine Learning GMM assignment

This assignment uses <mark>PCA</mark>, <mark>K-means clustering</mark>, and <mark>GMM and EM algorithms</mark>.

This approach from scratch implements a PCA analysis on the IRIS dataset to select the principal components and visualises them.
Then K-means clustering of the principal components is implemented and the cluster assignment visualised after which the accuracy is caculated.
Finally an General Method of Moments (GMM) algorithm and Expectation Maximisation steps (EM) are implemented for clustering from scratch.
The shapes of the clusters are visualised with plotly to draw ellipses around clusters and the accuracy upon convergence compared to the ground truth labels is calculated.
